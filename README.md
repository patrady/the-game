# Test Driven Development Project

## What Did I Learn

1. Having tests up-front makes it easier to
    1. Develop faster
    2. Account for edge cases
    3. Identify where logic should be split into different classes
    4. Decouple classes because repeated test setup is more noticeable
2. I start at a higher level of abstraction, I find myself getting distracted writing tests for the lower-level abstractions

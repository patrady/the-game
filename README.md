# Test Driven Development Project

## What Did I Learn

1. Having tests up-front makes it easier to
    1. Develop faster
        - I know what I am trying to fix next
    2. Account for edge cases
        - I find myself thinking through the edge scenarios sooner and more thoroughly
    3. Identify where logic should be split into different classes
    4. Decouple classes because repeated test setup is more noticeable
    5. Focus on what I should be doing next
    6. Refactor
        - I can write some ugly code to get it to pass and then I refactor it to beauty
        - My code and style is a lot easier to read
2. I start at a higher level of abstraction, I find myself getting distracted writing tests for the lower-level abstractions
3. I'm starting to find that I don't trust myself to edit a file without opening up the tests for it and creating a test case first. The evolution is real...
